                    With profound gratitude, I extend special acknowledgment to Dr. Jon Barron for generously providing
                    the template featured on this academic homepage. Dr. Barron's meticulous craftsmanship in crafting a
                    minimalist, yet optimistic and optimized template for academic websites is sincerely appreciated.
